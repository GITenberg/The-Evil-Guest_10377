description: Today, critics point to the work of Victorian-era horror author J. Sheridan
  Le Fanu as the pinnacle of suspense writing in the period. With a few subtle turns
  of phrase, Le Fanu can provoke a response of sheer terror in the minds of readers,
  working in the same vein that his American contemporary Edgar Allan Poe was able
  to master. The Evil Guest highlights all of Le Fanu's strengths as a writer, and
  it's sure to speed the heart of even the most seasoned horror fan.
